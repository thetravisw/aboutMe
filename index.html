                <li>I briefly considered a career as a food truck owner. My pulled pork beet ravioli is fire.</li>
                <br>
                <li>I know a little bit of Greek. Unfortunately it's Ancient Greek not modern Greek. Kinda useless.</li>
                <br>
                <li>I once played classical guitar on-stage at Benaroya Hall.</li>
                <br>
                <li>I don't even know how to smoke it, but I own a 3 foot long traditional Chinese water-pipe.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The first time I drove a car I was 11. It ended poorly.</li>
                <br>
                <li>I've slept in a hammock in sub-freezing temperatures.</li>
                <br>
                <li>When I was a young boy I lived in Antwerp Belgium.</li>
                <br>
                <li>When I'm trying to problem solve, I argue with myself out-loud. In order to keep the divergent points of
                    view mentally organized, I use (very poorly done) foriegn accents to voice each of them.</li>
                <br>
                <li>I once beat former world #8 rated chess player Yasser Sierwan in a game of speed chess. (He let me win. I
                    was 12. Still counts!)</li>
                <br>
                <li>Even though most of them seem made up, only one of the other items in this list is a lie. Can you guess which?</li>
                <br>
