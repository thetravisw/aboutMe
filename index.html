<h2 id=trivia>The 10 most interesting pieces of Travis Trivia:</h1>

<ol>
    <li>I know a little bit of Greek.  Unfortunately it's Ancient Greek not modern Greek.  Kinda useless.  Alethia Logos.  [True Story].</li>
    <li>I once played classical guitar on-stage at Benaroya Hall.</li>
    <li>I don't even know how to smoke it, but I own a 3 foot long traditional Chinese water-pipe.</li>
    <li>I briefly considered a career as a food truck owner.  My pulled pork beet ravioli is fire.</li>  
    <li>The first time I drove a car I was 11.  It ended poorly.</li>
    <li>I've slept in a hammock in sub-freezing temperatures.</li>
    <li>When I was a young boy I lived in Antwerp Belgium.</li>
    <li>When I'm trying to problem solve, I argue with myself out-loud.  In order to keep the divergent points of view mentally organized, I use (very poorly done) foriegn accents to voice each of them.</li>
    <li>I once beat former world #8 rated chess player Yasser Sierwan in a game of speed chess.  (He let me win.  I was 12. Still counts!)</li>
    <li>Even though most of them seem made up, only one of the other items in this list is a lie.  Can you guess which?</li>
